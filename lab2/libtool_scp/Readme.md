# Stupid C Program using GNU LibTool and GNU Make

This requires executable of [GNU LibTool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) (`libtool`).

**Note:** For Debian-based distributions, installing [`libtool`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/libtool) is usually not enough. You also need [`libtool-bin`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/libtool-bin).

Run:

```shell
make -j8 install
```

to install it to default location which is `opt` under the current directory.
