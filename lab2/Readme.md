# Lab 2: Understanding Build Systems

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the compiling process: Pre-processing, compile, assemble, link and load.
- Understand what a build system is and why it is important.
- Build software that uses representative build systems: GNU AutoTools and CMake.

## Preparation

1. GNU Bash >= 4.4.
2. GNU CoreUtils, GNU Grep, GNU Sed, and GNU AWK.
3. A valid C compiler. Both GCC and Clang will work.
4. GNU BinUtils.
5. GNU Make, GNU AutoConf, GNU AutoMake, GNU LibTool.
6. CMake.

## Files in this Directory

- `src`: The source code.
- `01_shell_scp`: Compilation script in pure shell.
- `02_libtool_scp`: Compilation script in GNU Makefile and GNU Libtool.
- `03_autotools_scp`: Compilation script in GNU AutoTools.
- `04_cmake_scp`: Compilation script in CMake.

Now let's pace into `src` and get see what we will build.
